FT  14 MAR 94 / US and Europe reach rare consensus: All agree on need for
greater labour flexibility
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mexican political threat. An unusual consensus has emerged - at least between the US and Europe - from
the dozens of papers produced by governments and think-tanks for the Group
of Seven jobs summit, which is to begin in Detroit today, even if there has
been no new big idea for solving the developed world's unemployment problem.
The three main voices in the debate - the US, the UK and the continental
European - backed by economists at the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development, are all emphasising a combination of greater
labour market flexibility, easier enterprise formation, more effective
active labour market measures and improvements in education and training.
There is even a broad consensus around one of the central causes of
unemployment in the developed world: that a combination of trade with
developing countries and technological change has permanently reduced demand
for less-skilled labour. Benefit systems and minimum wages put a floor under
unskilled wages in Europe, so the fall in demand has shown in rising
unemployment. In the US, on the other hand, the problem is expressed in
falling wages or resort to crime.
The policy challenge is to move as many people as possible into high-skill
jobs, while ensuring that labour markets are flexible enough to soak up the
rest without forcing down incomes too far. By their attendance at the
summit, all G7 countries implicitly accept that social engineering to deal
with this collapse in demand for unskilled labour, and to cut the time lag
between the destruction of old jobs and the creation of new ones, is
justified.
In political terms, both free-market liberals, represented most strongly by
the UK government, and social/Christian democrats, represented by
continental Europe and the European Commission, can sign to such a
combination of ideas. A Democratic administration in the US, interested in
European welfare and training systems but still wedded to many aspects of
its own flexible labour market, hovers between the two.
But the idea of mid-Atlantic convergence can also be misleading, because the
meeting point is far closer to the US than to the European coast. Indeed,
the starting point of the most influential analysis is considerably more
liberal and competitiveness-conscious than a decade ago.
The emphasis in Europe is on repairing the poor capacity of its economies to
create new jobs. In the US, which has produced 2m new jobs in the past 18
months, the emphasis is on producing higher-skilled, higher-paid jobs.
All the main parties to the debate, including the traditionally orthodox
OECD, are also careful to avoid advocating US-style wage differentials, and
real wage cuts (in 1972-1992 US average real wages fell by about 10 per
cent). Even the UK government, the strongest admirer of the US model, talks
about the balance to be struck between market forces and regulation.
The main clusters of ideas on the Detroit agenda are:
Wage and regulatory flexibility. The OECD has long advocated that Europe
increase its labour cost flexibility and reform its job security provisions.
The most surprising recent convert to this orthodoxy has been the European
Commission. The European Commission's White Paper on Growth, Competitiveness
and Employment, published at the end of last year, talks about a new
solidarity between the employed and the unemployed, and about 'remodelled'
regulation rather than de-regulation. But it pulls few punches on the
problems of European rigidity. It says that many social protection schemes
and wage bargaining systems have had a negative impact on employment,
protecting those in work at the expense of job-seekers, and says that there
is broad consensus from member states on the need for greater flexibility
and lower labour costs.
The most concrete policy proposal to create more jobs for the less skilled
and increase the 'employment-intensity' of the services sector is to
increase the burden of non-wage labour costs as incomes rise. At present,
the proportion falls as incomes rise in most European countries.
The US paper circulated to governments before the summit also stresses that
the main policy requirement for Europe - and Japan - is to reduce
restrictions on wage setting and employment adjustment which reduce the
incentives of the unemployed to find jobs and the incentives of employers to
create them.
Training, education and good jobs. The US paper says that, in the right
climate of innovation and entrepreneurship, new technology creates as many
jobs as it destroys. But, if all citizens are to qualify for these jobs, the
standards of basic education and training must be improved, especially in
the US, and the school-to-work transition must be better handled.
Active labour markets and more flexible welfare. The annual cost of
unemployment in the EU - including foregone income - is more than Ecu200bn
(Pounds 151bn) each year, greater than the GDP of Belgium. In recent years,
there has been a small shift towards active labour market measures -
training, job placement, and so on - but more than two-thirds of direct
spending on unemployment still goes on passive measures.
The challenge is to find ways of boosting the incomes of the unskilled in a
more economically efficient manner than just leaving them on benefits. The
problem is that Europe's social security systems were designed on the
assumption of full-time employment and have failed to adapt to the growth of
part-time and 'atypical' employment. Individuals find it difficult to move
from unemployment into anything other than full-time work because of the
steep claw-back of benefits.
Disagreements and other views. There are, of course, differences of emphasis
between the main participants, with most European countries playing down
cyclical factors and playing up structural factors, while the US still
believes that a good part of the unemployment problem is linked to low
growth.
'Countries which pursue structural improvements, without taking steps to
increase aggregate demand, will see little or no return for their efforts,'
warns the US paper. Japan, with the best record of any G7 country on jobs in
recent years, also warns in its otherwise orthodox paper against too much
emphasis on labour flexibility. 'Excessive mobility of workers discourages
incentives to enhance human resource development by enterprises,' it warns.
One idea - not on the Detroit agenda - which runs strongly counter to
economic orthodoxy is work-sharing. The EU White Paper was ambivalent about
it, rejecting 'a generalised reduction in working hours and job-sharing at
national level'.
Even so, as a preferable alternative to widespread redundancies for
companies in short-term trouble, reduced working time will remain on the
broader agenda.

FT  14 MAR 94 / Looking forward to a plan in Naples

<TEXT>
Finance and employment ministers from the Group of Seven leading industrial
nations gathered in Detroit last night for a two-day brainstorming session
on ways to tackle the persistent unemployment in their economies.
US officials hosting the jobs conference insist there will be no final
communique and no attempt at formal policy co-ordination, but President Bill
Clinton wants to use the conference's conclusions as the basis for the July
summit meeting of G7 leaders in Naples to agree a jobs plan.
For Mr Clinton, who will open the conference this morning, the meeting
offers a chance to focus on themes close to the heart of his administration,
after much distraction by the Whitewater affair.
Ministers from other G7 countries expect the Detroit meeting to agree on the
need for labour market flexibility, investment in education and training,
and open trade.
'We find we are talking from the same agenda,' said Mr David Hunt, UK
employment secretary.
Mr Larry Summers, US Treasury under-secretary for international affairs,
says the employment issue is of critical political importance for all the G7
countries.
But the seven nations are not unanimous on how big a role economic stimulus,
in the form of lower interest rates or tax cuts, should play in an overall
jobs policy.
US officials do not want to turn the Detroit meeting into a shouting match
with Germany's Bundesbank, but they continue to argue that Europe needs
further interest rate cuts to spur growth and job creation.
Ms Laura Tyson, chief White House economist, told the Financial Times that
she is yet to be convinced that Europe's unemployment problems can be as
much explained by structural problems, such as rigid labour market rules, as
her European counterparts argue.
'Between 1986 and 1990, the European G7 countries added about 5m jobs and
the unemployment rate went down from about 9 per cent to about 6.9 per cent.
Since 1990, the unemployment rate has gone up to about 9.2 per cent and the
level of employment has gone down by about 2m,' she noted.
"Unless you are willing to make the case that structural rigidities improved
a lot between 1986 and 1990, and then got worse again, a lot of that
deterioration has to be cyclical.'

FT  14 MAR 94 / Lack of training shuts out poor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When President Bill Clinton first called for a special conference to discuss
jobs and unemployment at the Group of Seven summit in Tokyo last summer, the
US economy was still recovering only anaemically from the 1990 recession,
and unemployment stood at 7 per cent.
Today, as the conference convenes in Detroit, the jobless rate is 6.5 per
cent - despite a change in the method of calculation that makes the figure
higher than under the old system.
Comparing the US record with that of Europe, some US commentators have
sneered at the purpose of the conference.
'Actually, there is no global crisis; there is only a European crisis,'
scoffed Mr Robert Samuelson in the magazine Newsweek. 'We have nothing to
learn from the Europeans about job creation, and the lessons they could
learn from us are the obvious ones that - for political and social reasons -
they can't adopt.'
Clinton administration officials, however, have spent the last week telling
anyone who would listen that, on the contrary, they still have a great deal
to learn from them.
While the US has indeed had much more dynamic job creation than the other G7
countries, they note, real wages in the US have stagnated for years. At the
same time, income disparities between the better trained and educated and
the less well trained have widened dramatically. Whole segments of the
population have been virtually shut out of the job market, with unemployment
approaching 70 per cent in some cases, such as inner-city black teenagers.
'Others could learn from US flexibility and dynamism. We could learn from
what others have done to facilitate the transition from school to work,'
said Mr Larry Summers, the treasury undersecretary for international
affairs.
Looked at over a period of decades, the US has consistently created new jobs
at a strong pace. The number of non-farm jobs grew by an average of 2.2 per
cent a year from 1950 to 1990.
Unemployment, meanwhile, oscillated between 4.9 per cent and 9.7 per cent in
the 1970s and 1980s, much lower than comparable European rates - although
some workers may give up the search for work quicker than they might in
Europe, since US benefits stop after 26 weeks.
At the start of the 1990s, employment stagnated as recession was followed by
a slow recovery which seemed to bring few new jobs in its wake. Last year,
net job creation picked up to 1.8 per cent - more robust, but still weak by
the standards of most post-war recoveries.
A new study by economists Steven Davis, John Haltiwanger and Scott Schuh at
the Census Bureau's Centre for Economic Studies shows that the gross
creation and destruction of jobs that produces these net annual figures is
far more dramatic.
Looking at data from individual manufacturing plants from 1973 to 1988, they
found that in a typical 12-month period 10.3 per cent of jobs disappeared,
while another 9.1 per cent were newly created.
While US workers have been finding jobs, their earnings, adjusted for
inflation, have fared worse. Average weekly earnings in the private sector,
measured in 1982 dollars, climbed from Dollars 261.92 in 1960 to Dollars
315.38 in 1973. Since then, they have slipped back steadily to only Dollars
255.99 at the end of 1993.
Within this overall decline, workers in the highest wages bracket saw their
earnings rise by an average of 4.4 per cent in real terms over the last 20
years, while workers in the bottom wage bracket saw a real fall in earnings
of 10.3 per cent.
Another Census Bureau study published last week shows that 18 per cent of
America's 81m full-time workers earned less than a poverty level wage of
Dollars 13,091 a year, compared with only 12 per cent in 1979.
Some European countries, while they may not have escaped the erosion of real
wages, have avoided this increase in inequality.
This does not just mean that the superior record of job creation in the US
has come entirely in low-wage, low-skill sectors such as fast food
restaurants.
'The US economy has not been producing McJobs disproportionately,' says Ms
Laura Tyson, chair of the White House council of economic advisers. 'We have
been creating jobs in good job classification categories, but that rate of
growth of compensation of those jobs has slowed.'
Some of the pressure on earnings has come from the spiralling cost of health
insurance, which is provided in most cases by employers who generally pass
on around 80 per cent of the costs to their workers in lower wages.
But even measures of total compensation, including health benefits, have
grown at a rate the Clinton administration finds disappointing.
The question ministers will address today and tomorrow is, in the words of
Mr Robert Reich, US labour secretary: 'Are the citizens of advanced
economies condemned to choose between, on the one hand, more jobs which pay
less and less, or good jobs but high levels of unemployment accompanying
those good jobs?
'I think there's a third choice, and that third choice may be to combine the
kind of investments in education and training and apprenticeship that we
find in Europe with the dynamic labour mobility and flexibility we find in
the US, all encased within macro-economic policies which encourage growth
and jobs.'

MADRID
Spain's Socialist government has found itself in a role it wanted badly to
avoid - as the villain of the piece, or as they say in Spanish 'the bad guy
in the film', over enlargement of the European Union. But by evoking
'national interests' it has ensured a broad front of support from the
country's press.
Most editorialists gave less importance to the wrangle with Norway over
fishing rights than Spain's demands for minority blocking votes in the
future 16-member EU. The leading Madrid daily El Pais described Spain's
decision to dig its heels in as 'unfortunate, but right'.
At stake was Spain's ability to prevent decisions on crucial issues being
imposed on it. The argument boiled down to 'a struggle to prevent Europe's
centre of gravity being definitively shifted northwards'. It recognised the
quandary this represented for Spain's ostensibly pro-European leaders.
'For some negotiators it is hard to resist the pressure and criticism from
friends, partners and allies. But in this instance there is no other way for
Spain, which favours enlargement, to defend interests of the first
magnitude.'
The right-wing daily ABC said the government's firmness was backed by all
political parties. But the government itelf was partly to blame for the
'terrible' way it negotiated Spain's entry eight years ago, leaving the
country 'in many sectors defenceless against a decision by Brussels.' As for
Norwegian cod, it hoped for 'a logical outcome which would cater for Spain's
legitimate demands without imposing intolerable conditions on Norway.'
The conservative Barcelona newspaper La Vanguardia commented: 'Anyone
shocked by Spain's attitude should also be shocked by the attitude of those
opposing its demands.' Norway, it conceded, was 'perfectly entitled to
defend its interests.' The difference was that the Norwegians were on the
outside trying to get in.
PARIS
Air France's request for FFr20bn (Pounds 2.3bn) in state aid, and the fact
that it accounted for half the losses made by all the world's airlines last
year, occupied much space - but provoked relatively little editorial comment
 -in the French press.
One exception, however, was La Tribune, the business daily, which said that
some would find it 'scandalous that the French taxpayer was having to dig
into his pocket again' to save Air France, and Bull the computer company,
and others 'would reckon that the bills presented by the new bosses of these
companies were a bit steep, even indecent, at a time when private companies
were having to take the risk of going to the markets for new money'.
The distortion of competition was too flagrant not to be noticed, said La
Tribune in language that could have come - and undoubtedly will - out of a
British Airways press release on the Air France aid request.
But the real problem, La Tribune said, was that Air France and Bull had
simply always lived sheltered lives, protected from the market and winds of
competition. Their recent history was a tale of 'money lost, energies wasted
and employees disappointed'.
However, Ouest France, produced in Bordeaux but with the largest circulation
in France, struck a more upbeat note. Mr Christian Blanc, Air France's new
boss had a record of solving knotty problems like the New Caledonian crisis
in the 1980s, and other French companies like Citroen had been able to pull
themselves rapidly together. But it said Air France's problem was that it
essentially lacked a business culture, and 'that will not be settled by a
cheque'.
SANTIAGO
Weekend papers were glowing in their accounts of the presidential handover,
a 'fiesta of democracy' in which Eduardo Frei, in the words of La Nacion,
'arrived in Valparaiso (home to Congress) as a common citizen and returned
to Santiago as president'.
For the most part, editors forgot their political differences and treated
the event as pageant. This was, after all, as La Epoca pointed out, the
first time in nearly 25 years that power had been transferred from one
democratically elected president to another. The last time was in 1970 when
Eduardo Frei's father handed the presidential sash to Salvador Allende.
The man responsible for breaking that sequence, General Augusto Pinochet,
attended Frei's inauguration in his capacity as commander-in-chief of the
armed forces. According to El Mercurio, the general's entrance 'was received
with loud and prolonged applause'. La Epoca noticed that, after the
ceremony, the general did not exit through the front door, but left 'via the
car parks'.
There was much praise for outgoing president Patricio Aylwin, though an
opinion piece in La Tercera thought his government had not properly
administered 'what it had received from its (military) predecessor'.
El Mercurio said that - discounting financial scandal at state copper
company Codelco, and a lax attitude towards crime - Aylwin's presidency 'had
been one of the most auspicious in the country's history'. It hoped
President Frei, a fellow Christian Democrat, would show the same
'moderation'.
La Nacion was less cautious. In a piece headlined 'Four unforgettable years'
it said: 'The historical merit of Aylwin is that he taught us to live in a
democracy once again.' Now that Chileans were not fighting for basic
political freedoms, they could concentrate on social problems, it said.
'Four years ago, it was not like that.'

Shortly after the Nato attack order was rescinded, UN officials reported the

Under attack by the Serbs since last June, the 19,000 residents of the
Moslem enclave in northern Bosnia have suffered great hardship, with all

FT  14 MAR 94 / Slovaks worry about jobs as political battle rages: The
crisis as Meciar fights for survival after losing a parliamentary vote of
no-confidence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK BLUM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Vladimir Meciar, Slovakia's beleaguered prime minister, begins what is
expected to be a long and bitter battle for his political survival today,
when he hands in his government's resignation.
Mr Meciar, who lost a parliamentary vote of no-confidence on Friday, has
already threatened to close down government by immediately pulling out all
his ministers.
While in theory a new government could be appointed within days, as is
clearly the hope of President Michal Kovac, disagreements within the
opposition and stalling tactics by Mr Meciar and his Movement for a
Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) could prolong the crisis.
Parliament must also approve a date for early elections - something it has
not been able to agree on until now. The next general election is not due
before 1996.
Mr Meciar - who is aware of conflicting interests within the opposition,
which ranges from the strongly christian KDH on the right to the reformed
communists in the Party of the Democratic Left (SDL) - has also thrown the
cat among the pigeons by pushing for a general election in June.
This was rejected by parliament as impractical, but the opposition then
failed to muster enough support for its own motion calling for elections in
November. Deputies representing the Hungarian ethnic minority held back
support in the hope of winning concessions for more autonomy.
The SDL will now try again on Wednesday with another motion calling for
elections in September-October, but it is by no means guaranteed it will win
the 90 votes required in the 150-seat parliament. The opposition could
muster only 78 votes in support of its no-confidence motion.
The HZDS has also gathered more than the 350,000 signatures required for a
petition to force a referendum on holding early elections and dismissing
deputies who have switched party. If the petition is accepted as legitimate,
President Kovac must order a referendum within 30 days, but even so
elections are likely to be delayed.
'It could take months before the situation is resolved,' a senior Slovak
official said privately yesterday.
Such political uncertainty could not come at a worse time, with the country
facing serious economic difficulties that may require unpopular measures.
The economy remains deeply in recession, unemployment already at 15 per cent
of the workforce is rising fast, and there may be renewed pressures for a
devaluation.
None of this would make a transitional government very popular.
The problem is compounded by the lack of clear political alternatives.
Opposition to Mr Meciar has been as much over his authoritarian style of
governing as about policies. None of the opposition parties has come up with
a distinct political progamme for government, focusing instead on piecemeal
policies.
Slovakia became independent almost against its own wishes on January 1993,
having to build most of its institutions from scratch.
It was short of qualified personnel, and its politicians had no experience
of running an independent country.
This has made for highly personalised and unpredictable politics, such as
attempts to find a third way between capitalism and socialism, that have
since been abandoned but did not help the country's international image or
encourage foreign investment.
Meanwhile, the past two years' political infighting has alienated an
increasing number of Slovaks. According to recent polls, about half eligible
voters do not intend to vote or do not know what to vote for. Younger voters
are most disaffected, though dissatisfaction is widespread.
'They don't care, they're just interested in power,' says a young biology
student in Bratislava. A taxi driver berates the politicians' constant
wheeling and dealing and has no time for the parliament. 'It's bad for
business,' he says.
Even officials are down-hearted. 'There's a big gap between what the
government thinks and what the people think,' a provincial chief of police
says.
Less than two years after victory in the June 1992 elections, and over a
year after independence, Mr Meciar's popularity has declined to around 15
per cent in opinion polls. The government has been weakened by successive
rows and defections, culminating in the recent damaging public confrontation
with the president.
Independence has not brought the prosperity promised by politicians, though
it is now accepted as irreversible. People are more worried about jobs and
security, but with every new twist in the political crisis, the uncertainty
deepens and prospects of economic recovery become more remote.
'Whatever happens it's going to take time. It's a mess, and its going to get
worse before it gets better,' one diplomat said.

FT  14 MAR 94 / Envoys near critical stage in hunt for Bosnian peace: US and
Russia anxious to begin drawing up maps
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The US and Russia, now co-ordinating every move in the search for peace in
the former Yugoslavia, want to resolve one of the more intractable aspects
of a settlement for Bosnia: the maps.
After three days of negotiations in Vienna, Zagreb and Sarajevo, Mr Charles
Redman, the US special envoy, and Mr Vitaly Churkin, his Russian
counterpart, are reaching a critical stage in negotiations over Bosnia's
future.
US and UN officials said that if the Bosnian Serbs could not be brought on
board to join the complex federation of Bosnia's Moslems and Croats - the
draft constitution of which was agreed by the two former adversaries in
Vienna yesterday - then the Bosnian Serbs would have to decide whether to
cede land in return for peace.
Otherwise, they added, the Bosnian Serbs could find themselves in a 'limbo',
with their territory The search for a settlement intensified over the
weekend when:
General John Galvin, the former supreme commander of Nato, helped forge a
defence agreement between Bosnia's Croats and Moslems leading to the
establishment of one Bosnian army. US officials stressed this would not
provide the means for a new offensive against the Bosnian Serbs. 'Its aim is
to stop the fighting between Croats and Moslems. It is also the first step
towards creation of a federation in one part of Bosnia,' a US official said.
After talks in Zagreb, the Croatian capital, Mr Churkin said he would not
rule out Serb participation in the federation. Even Mr Momcilo Krajisnik,
speaker of the Bosnian Serbs' self-proclaimed parliament and an important
negotiator, said Serbs were willing to join peace talks or some some kind of
co-existence with Moslems and Croats within Bosnia.
In Sarajevo, Bosnian Serb and Moslems said they had set up a preliminary
agreement to open up to civilian traffic routes in and out of the Bosnian
capital. This could be the beginning of the lifting of the siege, and an
eventual demilitarisation of the city.
Mr Churkin, who met Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic in Sarajevo
yesterday, will today hold talks with Serb leaders in Belgrade, the Serbian
capital. US officials said the talks could pave the way for an overall peace
settlement for Bosnia and Croatia.
Mr Churkin must establish today whether President Slobodan Milosevic of
Serbia is ready to sue for peace, which would lead to the lifting of
sanctions.
Any moves towards peace would require Belgrade persuading the Bosnian Serbs,
who hold nearly 70 per cent of Bosnia, to reduce their control to about 49
per cent.
During the Bosnian Croat and Moslem talks hosted by the US in Vienna, maps
have not been discussed for the federation as any decisions would have to
involve negotiations with the Bosnian Serbs.
Sections of the Bosnian Serb leadership are loath to cede any land. It would
mean breaking the fragile territorial corridors linking Serbs living in
Krajina, south-western Croatia, to Bosnian Serb territory, and ultimately to
Serbia proper.
'It is difficult to know if the links between Milosevic and the Krajina
Serbs are weaker than those between the Bosnian Serbs and Krajina,' a UN
negotiator said.
'Milosevic has to decide if he is prepared to weaken those links (with
Krajina) in return for sanctions being lifted; equally the Bosnian Serbs
must recognise they have no legitimacy as a self-proclaimed state if they do
not negotiate,' he added.
But the overriding consideration with regard to the status - and fate - of
the Krajina Serbs is the extent to which they can be used as pawns by
Belgrade in the hunt for a settlement with Croatia and Bosnia.
'The future status Krajina holds is the linchpin for peace between Croatia
and Serbia,' a UN peace negotiator said. 'Croatia wants full control of its
territory, including Krajina. But the Krajina Serbs do not want to live in
Croatia, regardless of pressure from Belgrade. They are the Achilles' heel.'
Despite this, Bosnian Serbs - and Mr Milosevic - continue to hold a strong
negotiating position. They can argue that the federation of Bosnian Croats
and Moslems will be linked to Croatia through a confederation, in effect
creating an eventual Greater Croatia and rewarding Croat gains in western
Hercegovina. Consequently they can ask why the Bosnian Serbs in eastern
Bosnian cannot link to Serbia proper.
'The answer is that the US wants to maintain a semblance of Bosnia's
territorial integrity. But we know that under a new guise, and with haggling
over the maps, Bosnia is already being carved up between Zagreb and
Belgrade,' a UN official said.

FT  14 MAR 94 / Balladur visits French troops in Bosnia

French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur paid an unannounced visit to French
troops serving with United Nations peacekeepers in former Yugoslavia
yesterday, Reuter reports from Paris.
Mr Balladur went first to Zagreb, Croatia, and was due to visit the Bihac
pocket in northern Bosnia, aides said.
He was accompanied by Defence Minister Francois Leotard on his visit to
units which came under Serb fire last week, when artillery rounds hit French
positions and a 22-year-old soldier was killed by a sniper.
French commanders are reported to be irate since a request they made for
Nato aircraft to strike back at the Serbs was turned down by UN commanders.
The Bihac pocket, where about 1,300 French troops are stationed, is a
Moslem-inhabited enclave surrounded by Serb troops.

FT  14 MAR 94 / Focus on the centre ground: Italian general elections
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As Italy's general election enters its final two weeks, attention has
switched to the large, undecided vote caused by the collapse of the
traditional centrist grouping.
Polls published last week showed that neither of the two main alliances on
the right and left were capable of winning an absolute parliamentary
majority. This raises the spectre of the centre, composed of the reshuffled
remnants of the five parties that have governed post-war Italy, acting as
arbiters in the formation of the next government.
The polls, the last permitted before the election on March 27, also
suggested that the momentum had slowed behind media magnate Silvio
Berlusconi's Forza Italia movement.
Mr Berlusconi himself suffered embarrassment over the weekend after his
younger brother Paolo admitted he had paid L1.3bn (Pounds 520,000) to
Socialist and Communist local councillors to secure a golf club development
at Basiglio near Milan. In connection with these payments, Milan magistrates
searched the home of Mr Alessandro Moneta, a former mayor of Basiglio and
currently southern Italy co-ordinator for Forza Italia.
According to a poll conducted by Directa, the Berlusconi-dominated
right-wing alliance would obtain 295 seats in the 630 lower house against
242 seats for the Progressive Alliance led by the former communist Party of
the Democratic Left (PDS).
The Directa poll - broadly endorsed by another conducted by Telemontecarlo -
indicated that the PDS will get a maximum of 135 seats in the chamber of
deputies with Reconstructed Communism, the hardline rump of the old
Communist party, winning up to 35 seats. The strength of Reconstructed
Communism and its damaging programme proposals, such as raising taxes on
government bonds, are imposing severe strains on the Progressive Alliance.
The centre parties, composed mainly of the former Christian Democrats
reformed under the Popular party (PPI) and referendum leader Mr Mario
Segni's Pact for Italy, would get 68. The remaining seats would go to the
small parties.
Seven former members of Italy's domestic intelligence service (Sisde) have
been sent for trial for allegedly embezzling L60bn following an
investigation by Rome magistrates lasting over nine months.

FT  14 MAR 94 / Brittan's book stirs debate on expansion
</HEADLINE>

The UK government faces renewed controversy over Europe today after the
premature release of a book by Sir Leon Brittan, in which the senior British
commissioner calls for a wide-ranging overhaul of decision-making in an
expanded European Union.
Sir Leon's views run counter to the UK's insistence on special protection
for the large member states which has led to deadlock in enlargement talks
with Sweden, Finland, Austria and Norway.
His proposals for institutional reform are also likely to stir up Tory
Euro-sceptics worried that UK Prime Minister John Major's government may be
about drop its hard-line stand and adopt a more pro-European manifesto ahead
of European Parliament elections in June.
Mr Major was warned yesterday that any retreat from his insistence on
maintaining the present voting system after enlargement would provoke new
convulsions within the Conservative party. But with other EU states
threatening to block enlargement unless the threshold for a blocking
minority within the council was raised from the present 23 votes, British
ministers acknowledged the dilemma.
Both Mr Major and Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, have been adamant
that the minority veto should not be diluted. The same point has been made
to Conservative party managers by Euro-sceptic MPs.
EU foreign ministers will attempt to rescue the enlargement talks at a
meeting tomorrow in Brussels. Spanish demands for access to 7,000 tonnes of
Norwegian cod appear likely to be accommodated after reports of a new offer
from Oslo; but hopes of settling the row over power-sharing rest on a
face-saving compromise which takes greater account of population.
Britain, supported by Spain, is pressing to maintain the present voting
arrangements which allow two large nations and a smaller country to block
their partners. Germany and other EU members want to raise the 'blocking
minority' threshold to 27 votes. One compromise under review is to increase
the blocking minority to 27 votes, on condition it would not apply if
countries representing more than 40 per cent of the population wanted to
hold up decisions.
Mr Javier Solana, Spanish foreign minister, said in an interview with the El
Pais newspaper yesterday: 'I hope in the coming days we can find a formula
that will satisfy our legitimate aspirations.'
Friends of Sir Leon said last week that he was dismayed at the UK
government's apparent willingness to jeopardise enlargement, a goal
previously judged to be central to Britain's European policy.
The chief EU trade negotiator, who is a candidate to succeed Mr Jacques
Delors as president of the European Commission, argues in his book that
institutional reform is inevitable. He urges the UK to prepare actively for
the entry of the former communist countries of central and eastern Europe in
the Union.
In his book, Sir Leon proposes the introduction of a three-tier voting
system which would balance the need for accelerated decision-making without
upsetting the balance between the big and smaller member states.
The first tier would cover internal market measures, health and safety at
work, farm and fisheries policies, as well as the purchase and sale of goods
and services anywhere in the EU. These measures would be subject to 'low
majority' voting, making it harder for countries to muster a blocking
minority.
A second tier would cover social rules and the environment, as well as
'exceptional trade measures' such as action against low-cost imports. This
would make a majority in favour of action harder to achieve, though still
not impossible for a single country to block.
A third tier would cover the levying of taxes, all moves to European
economic and monetary union, increasing the EU's budget, and all laws on
visas and immigration. On these matters of 'core sovereignty', governments
would retain their right to veto.
Sir Leon's book is part of his undeclared campaign to succeed Mr Delors. It
is already on sale at the European Parliament in Strasbourg, although it was
not due to appear until the end of the month.
